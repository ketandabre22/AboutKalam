            <h2 class="head2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR was an Indian aerospace
                  scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                  raised in
                  Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
                  as a scientist and
                  science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
                  Space Research
                  Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
                  missile development
                  efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                  ballistic missile
                  and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                  political role in
                  India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                  1974.<br><br>

                  Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                  Janata Party and
                  the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
                  returned to his
                  civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
                  several prestigious
                  awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.<br><br>

                  While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                  from an apparent
                  cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
                  the funeral
                  ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.<br></p>

            <h2 class="head2">Early life and education</h2>
            <p class="para1">Muhammad APJ Abdul Kalam (Urdu:
                  Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                  pilgrimage centre of
                  Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
                  father Jainulabdeen
                  Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
                  housewife.[10][11][12][13] His
                  father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                  uninhabited
                  Dhanushkodi.<br><br>

                  Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had
                  been wealthy
                  Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                  Muslim ethnic group
                  found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
                  family business had
                  involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
                  ferrying pilgrims
                  between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
                  however, the businesses
                  failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
                  The family was
                  poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                  family's meager
                  income. <br><br>
                  In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                  who had a strong
                  desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
                  education at Schwartz
                  Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College,
                  Tiruchirappalli from where he
                  graduated in Physics in 1954.<br><br>

                  Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13]
                  While Kalam was
                  working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened
                  to revoke his
                  scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
                  impressing the Dean, who
                  later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23]
                  He narrowly missed
                  achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
                  positions were
                  available in the IAF.<br>

      <h2 class="head2">Career as a scientist</h2>
      <p class="para1">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
            Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
            of India) as
            a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
            career by
            designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the
            INCOSPAR,
            working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO
            by H. G. S.
            Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was
            transferred to
            the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite
            Launch
            Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam
            had first
            started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the
            government's
            approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.<br>
            <br>

            Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center
            in
            Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort
            to develop
            the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
            successful.<br><br>

            Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
            representative of
            TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two
            projects, Project
            Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful
            SLV
            programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret
            funds for
            these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an
            integral role
            convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[29] His
            research and
            educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to
            initiate an
            advanced missile programme under his directorship.<br><br> Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and
            scientific adviser
            to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a
            proposal for
            simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R
            Venkatraman
            was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named
            Integrated Guided
            Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30] Kalam played a major
            part in
            developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and
            Prithvi, the
            tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost
            and time
            overruns.<br><br>

            Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and
            Development
            Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period
            in which he
            played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along
            with
            Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made
            him the
            country's best known nuclear scientist.[33] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that
            the
            thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam
            and
            Chidambaram dismissed the claims.<br><br>

            In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju
            Stent".[36][37] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was
            named the
            "Kalam-Raju Tablet".<br>

      <h2 class="head2">Presidency</h2>
      <p class="para1">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
            presidential election with an
            electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July
            2002, to 25
            July 2007.<br><br>
            On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
            would
            nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress
            Party backed
            his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to
            seek a second
            term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:
      <ul class="list1">
            <li>I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a
                  message. I was thinking
                  what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.</li>
            <li>On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his
                  senior Cabinet
                  colleagues.</li><br>

                  Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
                  The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
                  assemblies, with the media
                  claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the
                  count was held on
                  18 July.<br>
                  Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[48] and
                  moved into the
                  Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to
                  have been honoured
                  with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli
                  Radhakrishnan (1954) and
                  Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of
                  India.[50] He was also
                  the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.<br><br>

                  During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,[52][53][54]
                  saying that signing the
                  Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.[55][56][57] Kalam was
                  criticised for his
                  inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his
                  tenure.[58] Article 72 of
                  the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the
                  death sentence of
                  convicts on death row.[58][59] Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as
                  president, rejecting the
                  plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[58] Perhaps the most notable plea was from
                  Afzal Guru, a
                  Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian
                  Parliament and was
                  sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[59] While the sentence was scheduled to be
                  carried out on 20
                  October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.[59] He also
                  took the
                  controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.<br><br>

                  In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform
                  Civil Code in India,
                  keeping in view the population of the country.[61][62][63][64]

                  At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in
                  office provided
                  there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[65] However, two days later,
                  he decided not to
                  contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan
                  from any political
                  processes.[66] He was proposed by third front named United National Progressive Alliance leader J.
                  Jayalalithaa and
                  coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did
                  not have the support
                  of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.<br><br>

                  Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in
                  April claimed that
                  Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71] After the reports, social networking
                  sites witnessed a
                  number of people supporting his candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed
                  verification],
                  saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian
                  National Congress
                  proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.[74][75] A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh
                  Yadav and Mamata
                  Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Indian National Congress opposed the nomination
                  of Kalam in
                  2012.[77] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary
                  supporter.[78] On 18
                  June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:

                  Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for
                  me and the
                  aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect
                  it. I want to thank
                  them for the trust they have in me.<br>
